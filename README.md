# mac_assistant

This project is specifically for to be used on Macs.
Made this program bot for just personal navigation and small tasks using my voice and communication via notification systems like system and emails.

Able to open software applications, google search, search images, write blogs and daily logs, used for attending college online lectures.

Aim: less physical movement and more work using voice commands.
A bluetooth earphone should give you more freedom , feel like actual Jarvis...(maybe close)
